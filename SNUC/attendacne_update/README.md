# Mail ID Matcher
As the LMS IDs of the students are roll-number based, while the attendance sheet we received is registration number based, we considered email IDs as unique identifiers to accurately identify the students.
This project provides a Python script to match mail IDs from a CSV file against an Excel file (with multiple sheets).  
If a match is found, the script copies the corresponding value from the **35th column** of the Excel sheet.

## üìÇ Input Files

- **File A (CSV)**
  - This is a list of students in csv format 
  - Contains mail IDs in the **5th column**.  
  - First **9 rows are skipped** (data starts from row 10).  

- **File B (Excel, `.xlsx`)**
  - Log in LMS
  - Go to Attendecne
  - Go to Export
  - Download attendacne in xlsx format 
  - May contain multiple sheets.  
  - Each sheet has mail IDs in the **5th column**.  
  - Value to be copied is in the **35th column**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How it Works

1. Read `file_a.csv` and extract mail IDs from the 5th column (row 10 onwards).  
2. For each mail ID:
   - Search through all sheets of `file_b.xlsx`.  
   - If a match is found in the 5th column, copy the value from the 35th column.  
   - Record the sheet name where the match was found.  
3. If no match is found, record `None`.  
4. Save the results to a new Excel file `output_results.xlsx`.
5. **Copy the 3rd Column of `output_results.xlsx` and paste it in the specific column of file A**
6. **Please update the total number of class too in File A**
